The best 3-point shooters in the NBA hit around 40% of their attempts with [Kyle Korver](http://espn.go.com/nba/player/stats/_/id/2011/kyle-korver) leading the way at nearly 50%.  An oft-forgotten detail is that these numbers occur against NBA level defenses.  What would these guys shoot under little or no pressure, ie what would they shoot in practice?
