## **Putting it all together**

Finally we are in a position to properly count Steph Curry's streak.  On any given day, Steph's chances of making 77 or more in a row are:

\[
1 - F_{100}(76)
\]

and the chances of him doing this at least once over 1000 days is given by:

\[
1 - (F_{100}(76))^{1000}
\]
