## **Putting it all together**

Finally we are in a position to properly count Steph Curry's streak.  On any given day, Steph's chances of making a "newsworthy" streak happen are:

\[
1 - F_{100}(70)
\]

and the chances of him doing this at least once over 1000 days is given by:

\[
1 - (F_{100}(70))^{1000}
\]

To make this a likely occurrence (odds greater than \(50\%\), Steph's percentage needs to be above \(88.5\%\).  If he got lucky (odds greater than \(1\%\), that falls to about \(83\%\).  Feel free to play with the graph below to see how various factors influence this calculation.
