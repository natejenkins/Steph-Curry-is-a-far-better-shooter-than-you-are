\textbf{\label{fig:right_way}} Probability of having a streak at least as long as "Streak Length" for a given shooting percentage.  The dark orange curve is the full calculation which takes into account all of the different ways a player can consecutively make "Streak Length" number of shots.  The blue curve is the naive calculation from figure \ref{fig:wrong_way}.  You can see that using the naive method overestimates the shooting percentage required to succeed for a given streak.
