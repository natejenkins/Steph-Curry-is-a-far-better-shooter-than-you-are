This is a hard number to get at since we don't generally have access to practice statistics of NBA players.  However, there is some recent anecdotal evidence that we can use to give an estimate for one of NBA's best shooters, Stephen Curry.  It was [recently](http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/12692397/stephen-curry-golden-state-warriors-makes-77-consecutive-3-pointers-practice) that Steph recently hit 77 3-pointers in a row in practice and 94 out of 100 total.  

### The wrong way

Calculating his likely shooting percentage is kind of tricky but we can first make an estimate assuming (incorrectly) that he didn't shoot 100 3 pointers, but instead stopped at 77 (if this kind of simplification bothers you then don't become a physicist).  In this case his one-day probability is the following:

\(\textrm{One day Prob} = {p_3}^{77}\)

Let's assume for the moment that he shoots the same percentage in practice as in an actual NBA game.  Looking at his [stats](http://espn.go.com/nba/player/stats/_/id/3975/stephen-curry), in 2015 this stands at 44%.  Plugging that in to our equation we get:

\({0.44}^{77} = 3.51*10^{-28}\)

Clearly Steph shoots a bit better than that in practice.  How much better?  Steph has been a professional basketball player for 6 seasons.  Let's say he does this shooting drill every day he practices over those 6 seasons and that adds up to a total of 1000 days where he had an opportunity to set this number.  We also have to assume that this would be newsworthy, ie this is not something he pulls off everyday.
