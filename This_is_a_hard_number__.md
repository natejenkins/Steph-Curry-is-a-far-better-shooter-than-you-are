This is a hard number to get at since we don't generally have access to practice statistics of NBA players.  However, there is some recent anecdotal evidence that we can use to give an estimate for one of NBA's best shooters, Stephen Curry.  It was reported that Steph recently hit 77 3-pointers in a row in practice.  Given a certain 3-point shooting percentage and assuming he takes 100 3-pointers in this shooting drill, it is easy to calculate his one day probability of hitting 77 in a row:

\(\textrm{One day Prob} = {p_3}^{77}\)

Let's assume for the moment that he shoots the same percentage in practice as in an actual NBA game.  Looking at his [stats](http://espn.go.com/nba/player/stats/_/id/3975/stephen-curry), in 2015 this stands at 44%.  Plugging that in to our equation we get:

\({0.44}^{77} = 3.51*10^{-28}\)
