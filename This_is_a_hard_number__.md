This is a hard number to get at since we don't generally have access to practice statistics of NBA players.  However, there is some recent anecdotal evidence that we can use to give an estimate for one of NBA's best shooters, Stephen Curry.  It was [recently](http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/12692397/stephen-curry-golden-state-warriors-makes-77-consecutive-3-pointers-practice) reported that Steph recently hit 77 3-pointers in a row in practice and 94 out of 100 total.  We're going to estimate his 3-point shooting percentage in two different ways: the easy, wrong way, and the not-so-easy right way.
