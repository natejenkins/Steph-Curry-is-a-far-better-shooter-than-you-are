# **The right way**

What was so wrong about the above calculation?  The article mentioned that Steph didn't shoot until he missed, he shot 100 3-pointers, making 77 in a row and 94 out of 100.  Limiting the calculation to a total of 77 shots means that if he misses the first attempt it is game-over, yet in reality he could start his streak on any shot up to and including the 24th.  Furthermore, our calculation stipulated that he had a streak of exactly 77 shots, but it probably still would have been newsworthy had it been 76 shots, and certainly newsworthy if he made 78, 85, or 95 in a row.
