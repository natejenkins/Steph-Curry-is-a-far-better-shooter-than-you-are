# **The right way**

What was so wrong about the above calculation?  The article mentioned that Steph didn't shoot until he missed, he shot 100 3-pointers, making 77 in a row and 94 out of 100.  Limiting the calculation to a total of 77 shots means that if he misses the first attempt it is game-over, yet in reality he could start his streak on any shot up to and including the 24th.  What we'd really like to know is that given 100 shots total, what are the chances he hits 77 or more in a row.  The calculation relies on some very tricky counting, so let's cut to the chase (and interested parties can continue after the figure to see the full derivation):  
To make this a likely occurrence (odds greater than \(50\%\)), Steph's percentage needs to be above \(89.5\%\).  If he got lucky (odds greater than \(1\%\)), that falls to about \(84.5\%\).  Feel free to play with the graph below to see how various factors influence this calculation.
