# The right way

What was so wrong about the wrong way?  The article mentioned that Steph didn't shoot until he missed, he shot 100 3-pointers, made 77 in a row, and 94 out of 100.  Limiting the calculation to a total of 77 shots means that if he misses the first attempt it is game-over, yet in reality he could start his streak on any shot up to and including his 24th.  To calculate this properly we first need to talk about flipping coins.
