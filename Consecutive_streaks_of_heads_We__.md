## **Consecutive streaks of heads**

We can now calculate the chances of getting \(k\) heads in \(n\) flips, but what we really want to know is the probability of having a run of consecutive heads longer than some value \(x\).  There is an excellent resource \cite{Schilling1990} that elaborates on how to do this, with the basic idea being the following (I've tried to keep my notation in line with that of \cite{Schilling1990}):

Let \(F_n(x)=R_n{\leq}x\)
If we knew the probability of having a run \(R_n\) less than or equal to \(x\), let's call this:
