I've played a lot of basketball in my life, and have come across some amazing shooters, but I haven't seen anyone come close to these kind of numbers.

## **Final note**

In the same [report](http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/12692397/stephen-curry-golden-state-warriors-makes-77-consecutive-3-pointers-practice), Klay Thompson guesstimated his own streak at 36. That puts him at a likely practice percentage of around \(76\%\).
